# Getting_Cleaning_Data
Project Getting and Cleaning Data

This project is related to the data cleaning of an experiment that was performed with 30 volunteers, in the range of 19 to 48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) using a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) at the waist.

Several measures of this experiment were collected using a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope, but in this sample we computed and presented only Mean and Standard Deviation data of these measurements (see file Code_book.txt).
